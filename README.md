# Future Development 
Im going to add more questions with more grading systems impplemented in the game as well as sound audio for when the user answers the question correctly. I am also going to work on the css and design layout and it will have alot more eye candy so the viewer doesnt get bored from the game. Also adding the ability to go up against another opponent would be a great feature to add. Adding a pool of questions so that every time a user starts the game over the game will spawn different questions making it more fun for the user.
