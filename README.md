# GA-SEIR129_TriviaGame

Have you been paying attention to the rap scene of 2019? Well here is a game that will test your knowledge.

I used Javascript with HTML and CSS for this Game. 

I first started with my HTMl and i linked all my scripts for the game. I then moved on to creating all the questions/types. From there i created a button form for when the user is done with there trivia game. After that i moved on to my js and started with adding logic to each question i had wrote in my html. I stated what the correct answer was for each question and created three systems of grading the game. I then added three pictures for each grading system output. After i wrote the logic i then started on the styling using css.
